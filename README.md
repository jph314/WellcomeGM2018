# Wellcome GM 2018

A Python data analysis investigating trust in medical advice in the UK using Wellcome Global Monitor 2018. 

The analysis uses various libraries to organise and visualise the data and includes chi-squared tests of independence and a multivariate logistic regression model. It makes use of a weighted average and Gini impurity for ready comparison between single variables and probabilities calculated by the logistic regression model for comparison between multiple-variable groups.

The data used is stored in the file 'wgm_2018_uk.csv' and the analysis is stored in a Jupyter Notebook 'Trust Me.ipynb' and also converted to html 'Trust Me.html'. One image 'gini_impurity.png' is attached to illustrate the Gini impurity calculation.
